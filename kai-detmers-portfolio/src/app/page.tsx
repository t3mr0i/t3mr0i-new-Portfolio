            I'm Kai Detmers, a digital designer and programmer from Bremen, Germany. My passion for Digital Media sparked at the tender age of six, and it has only grown since. The ever-evolving landscape of technology fascinates me. I stay current in this dynamic industry through audiobooks, podcasts, and connecting with like-minded individuals at conferences. A particular interest of mine is Virtual Reality. I was among the first backers of Oculus Rift on Kickstarter, and now manage a Facebook Group dedicated to mobile VR, boasting around 3,000 members. Despite the fluctuating hype, I firmly believe in VR as the future of computing.
